<h1>Welcome to the <u>2D-RPG-System</u> repository!</h1>
<p>This template was created by <b>Alex Steiner</b> and it is designed to help you quickly set up a 2D RPG game. This template contains all the basic mechanics that are needed to create a 2D RPG game, including dialogue with bubbles mechanics, buying mechanics, and game state saving. With this template, you can easily create your own 2D RPG game without having to start from scratch.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Dialogue with bubbles mechanics:</b> This allows for easy implementation of in-game dialogue between characters and the player. The dialogue system is designed to be easy to use and customize. It includes the ability to add different character images, text, and sound effects to the dialogue.</li>
  <li><b>Buying mechanics:</b> Players can purchase items from in-game NPCs using in-game currency. The buying mechanics include a simple inventory system, where players can view and manage the items they have purchased. This system also includes a shop system, where players can buy items from NPCs using in-game currency.</li>
  <li><b>Saving game state:</b> The template has a built-in system that allows for the saving of the player's progress, including their inventory, money, and location in the game world. This system saves the game state in a binary file, which can be loaded later, to continue the game.</li>
